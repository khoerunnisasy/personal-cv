# Personal CV Website

This is the first **Curriculum Vitae (CV)** website I've ever built. It marks the beginning of my journey in learning and developing websites using only **HTML** and **CSS**, without any frameworks or libraries.

The goal of this project is to showcase personal information, including:
- A short introduction
- Education background
- Professional experience
- Contact details

This project reflects my initial understanding of **HTML structure** and **basic CSS layout**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🚀 Live Demo
Check out the live version on GitHub Pages:

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to structure a basic website with HTML
- How to apply styling with CSS from scratch
- The importance of separating structure (HTML) and style (CSS)
- How to deploy a simple website using GitHub Pages

## 📝 Notes
This is a beginner-level project created as a first step into the world of web development. I plan to improve and redesign this CV as I grow my skills and experience in Front-End Development.
